			<div class="accordion-item" id="question1">
				<a  class="accordion-link" href="#question1">
					Check your internet connection!
					
					</a>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>
					Make sure your internet connection is in order and have a backup ready just in case there's a network issue with one connection. Yes, there may always be unforeseen problems but it never hurts to be prepared :)
</p>

				</div>
				
			</div>
			<div class="accordion-item" id="question2">
				<a  class="accordion-link" href="#question2">
					What time is it starting?
					
					</a>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>
					Be sure to have all the meeting details ready well before the class, including the time. You must start the meeting as the host, and to avoid any last minute network issues that may cause tardiness, be punctual!
				</p>
				</div>

				</div>
				<div class="accordion-item" id="question3">
				<a  class="accordion-link" href="#question3">
					Where is the link?
					
					</a>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>
					Send your students the link to the meeting well before the class to avoid last minute confusion. Try to have one recurring meeting link for one class to make life easy for yourself!

</p>
				</div>
				</div>
				<div class="accordion-item" id="question4">
				<a  class="accordion-link" href="#question4">
					Am I audible?
					
					</a>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>

					Before starting off the class, check your audio and make sure the students can hear you clearly. Seems like an obvious point, but overlooked by more teachers than you might think!
</p>

				</div>
				</div>
				<div class="accordion-item" id="question5">
				<a  class="accordion-link" href="#question5">
					Can you see me?
					
					</a>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>

					If you choose to turn on your camera, do check the camera placement and video angle. Make sure you look professional, just as you would in a traditional classroom setting!
</p>

				</div>
				</div>
				<div class="accordion-item" id="question6">
				<a  class="accordion-link" href="#question6">
					Where are my notes?
					
					</a>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>
					Have your notes, presentations and videos ready to be shared before the class begins. You may choose to share your screen to teach, make sure you have all the material to be shared open and ready to be shared!
				</p>
				</div>
				</div>
				<div class="accordion-item" id="question7">
				<a  class="accordion-link" href="#question7">
					Keep silent! Turn off the music!
					
					</a>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>

					Establish the ground rules for the meeting as soon as it starts. Make it clear to the students when they are supposed to stay silent and when they must interact. This will save a lot of trouble that you may face.
				</p>
				</div>
				</div>
				<div class="accordion-item" id="question8">
				<a  class="accordion-link" href="#question8">
					Please unmute! Class!
					
					</a>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>
					You might face a passive class in an online setting. Make sure to provide incentives to promote interaction in the class. From a simple star or heart emoji for juniors to internal assessment marks for seniors, incentives can go a long way!
				</p>
				</div>
				</div>
				<div class="accordion-item" id="question9">
				<a  class="accordion-link" href="#question9">
					Can you hear me?
					
					</a>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>

					Another variant of "Am I audible?", this one all comes down to owning a good headset. Try to invest in a good microphone and speakers, now that the mode of education would be primarily online.
</p>

				</div>
				</div>
				<div class="accordion-item" id="question10">
				<a  class="accordion-link" href="#question10">
					Know your platform!
					
					</a>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>
					The most important mantra to keep in mind! Be it Zoom, Google Meet or Microsoft Teams, you must know the platform. Be sure of what button to press to share your screen, how to mute participants and other basic controls. This would go a long way in making your first online class a major success!
